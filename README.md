# face-obfuscation

Facial recognition is a concept first pioneered in the 1960s . Woody
Bledsoe, Helen Chan Wolf and Charles Bisson attempted to detect
human faces with computers, however they were severely limited
by the technology at the times. Since then, the technology has
evolved substantially and is used in a variety of applications. For
example,
Law enforcement agencies use it as a way to identify suspects or
other persons at the scene of a crime. Most mobile phone cameras
utilize facial recognition to focus on faces to capture better portrait
images. Social media companies are known to use it to identify users
who’s faces appear across multiple posts. Facebook has received
significant backlash as it could present a breach in privacy.
In today’s world, many applications present a dichotomy of
privacy and usefulness to society as a whole. Many still feel that
privacy is the most important aspect to one’s life, however.
